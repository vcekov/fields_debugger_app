### Enable and disable fields
Here the green buttons mean the field is enabled. You can toggle the enabled state of the field by clicking on that button and it will cycle between green and red.

### Show and hide fields
The "eye" icon is clickable. It indicates if the field is visible. You can toggle visibility from there.

### Changing the field label
Click on the fields label and edit the label as it is displayed in an editable text field.

### Editing drop down options
Click on one of the buttons next to the drop down controls:
- "O" button (short for Options)
- "OValue" (short for Option Values)
- "Ogroup" (short for Option Groups)

On the right you will see the options rendered. You can edit their labels, visibility and enabled status in a similar fashion as described above.
